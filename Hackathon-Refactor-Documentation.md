# 🧑‍🎨 Frontend Refactor
As part of the Euphrates Hackathon, I was responsible for revamping the entire frontend of the project located in the /view directory. My contributions focused on improving the UI/UX, ensuring consistency, and applying best practices throughout.

## ✅ HTML Template Styling
I restyled the following templates for a more polished and modern interface:

### Core Pages

- signup.html

- login.html

- dashboard.html

- profile.html

- memos.html

- research.html

- contributions.html

- benefits.html

- allocation.html

- error-template.html

- layout.html

- Tutorial Section (/view/tutorial)

- a1.html – a10.html

- layout.html

- redos.html

- ssrf.html

# 🧭 Navigation Overhaul

- Implemented a consistent navigation experience across all pages.

- Unified styles and layouts for headers, footers, and sidebars.

- Ensured that navigation flows intuitively and logically.

# 🌟 Best Practices

Used semantic HTML structure and meaningful class names.

Improved accessibility (ARIA tags, alt attributes).

Optimized layout responsiveness for various screen sizes.

Maintained clean, readable, and scalable code structure.

# 📝 Template for Other Sections
Use this structure when documenting backend, DevOps, or cloud tasks:

🔧 [Your Section Title] (e.g., Backend Refactor)
Brief overview of your role or what this section covers.

# ✅ Key Changes
[Describe major improvements or features added]

[List of files or modules worked on]

[Tech stack used if relevant]

# 🔍 Focus Areas
[Refactoring logic / improving performance / bug fixing / etc.]

[Security improvements / validations / error handling]

# 🛠️ Best Practices Followed
[E.g., used RESTful conventions, MVC structure]

[Code readability, modularization, commenting]

[Testing strategies if any]
